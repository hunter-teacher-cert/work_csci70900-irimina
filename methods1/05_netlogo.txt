Task: 
Consider a course where NetLogo is used as the primary programming language (or one of them). 


How would you introduce NetLogo on day 1? Why would you choose to do things that way? Put your answers in a text file (markdown preferred, not required) in your meth1 folder with the name 05_netlogo.


I would introduce NetLogo by having the class explore a specific teacher selected model. The students will work in pairs or trios to explore the model and investigate the answers to specific questions. There will be no programming on day 1. The focus will be on student engagement and connection to the real world by using computer modeling. 


For example, I would have them investigate Virus on a Network model and have them try to determine how a computer virus spreads in a network within certain variables. Students can simulate the spread of the virus and resistance to it by manipulating the variables present in the control dashboard. 


Using the sliders, students can choose the NUMBER-OF-NODES and the AVERAGE-NODE-DEGREE (average number of links coming out of each node). The INITIAL-OUTBREAK-SIZE slider determines how many of the nodes will start the simulation infected with the virus. The VIRUS-SPREAD-CHANCE, VIRUS-CHECK-FREQUENCY, RECOVERY-CHANCE, and GAIN-RESISTANCE-CHANCE sliders can be manipulated in order to visualize in the spread and resistance to the virus.  


Students are already somewhat familiar and intrigued with computer viruses and this simulation provides a great visual of a virus spread. The topic seems engaging and the students have the opportunity to model their own virus under specific constraints. Based on their variables setup, the students can see the outcome of the virus spread versus the resistance to it. 


One of the nice things about NetLogo is that students need very minimal instruction to get it started and it is pretty easy to use the sliders to set up their model.
